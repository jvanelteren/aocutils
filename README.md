## Install

``` sh
pip install -e .
```

This installs locally and refreshes changes to the codebase
automatically

## How to use

Import the functions from the submodules

``` python
from aocutils.grid import arr_to_dict
arr_to_dict([('a', 1), ('b',5)])
```

    {(0, 0): 'a', (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 'b', (1, 1): 5}
